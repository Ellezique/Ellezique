I am a current student at Coder Academy undertaking a full-stack web-development bootcamp, seeking to gain industry experience following course completion in August 2021.

I am a creative personality with a passion for the arts, learning and research. I love coffee, reading, playing games and watching film, series etc.

I currently yield the powers of: HTML, CSS, Git, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, APIs and React. I plan on expanding my skills to include: MongoDB, Node.js, Mongoose, Express.js and Redux.
